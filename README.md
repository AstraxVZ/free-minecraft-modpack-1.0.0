## About

This is a free Minecraft modpack that is currently being worked on.
I will get new mods somewhere in 2023.
If you find a bug, report it and I will patch this as soon as possible. I will also install some libraries for mods.

* Note that Quark may break. Delete Quark, if anything breaks.

## Installation Guide

To install this, follow these steps:
1. Download and install Forge for 1.18.2
2. Download this repository as a ZIP file and extract it
3. Put all the JAR files from the extracted folder into mods folder in Minecraft directory
4. Run Minecraft Forge 1.18.2
    1. Forge should be 40.2.0 or above
    2. Forge versions under 40.2.0 will not work since some mods require Forge 40.2.0 or above
5. Mods are installed
